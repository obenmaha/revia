## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS REQUIRED

### **STEP 1: Verify Deployment (Do This NOW - 5 minutes)**

#### 1.1 Check Vercel Dashboard

**Action**: Go to your Vercel dashboard
**URL**: https://vercel.com/[your-team]/app-kine/deployments

**What to look for**:

- ✅ Deployment status should show "Ready" (green checkmark)
- ✅ Deployment time: Should complete in 2-5 minutes after push
- ✅ Production URL: Note your production domain

**If status shows "Building"**: Wait 2-3 more minutes
**If status shows "Error"**: Check build logs immediately (see troubleshooting section below)

#### 1.2 Test Production URL

**Action**: Open your production URL in a browser

**Your production URL is likely one of**:

- `https://app-kine.vercel.app`
- `https://revia.vercel.app`
- Custom domain if configured

**Quick Health Checks**:

```bash
# Test 1: Check site loads
curl -I https://[your-production-url].vercel.app
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 OK

# Test 2: Check if app renders
curl https://[your-production-url].vercel.app | grep -i "revia\|app-kine"
# Expected: Should see HTML with app name
```

#### 1.3 Manual Smoke Tests (3 minutes)

**Open your production URL in browser and test**:

- [ ] **Homepage loads** (no errors in console)
- [ ] **Click "Login"** - does login page appear?
- [ ] **Try to register** - does form work?
- [ ] **Test Guest Mode** - can you create a session without login?

**If ANY of these fail**: See Rollback section below

---

### **STEP 2: Enable Monitoring (Do This in Next 30 Minutes)**

#### 2.1 Enable Sentry Error Tracking

**Why**: Catch production errors in real-time

**Actions**:

1. **Go to**: https://sentry.io (or sign up if new)
2. **Create project**: "Revia v1.4.0-beta"
3. **Get DSN**: Copy the Sentry DSN key
4. **Add to Vercel**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/[team]/app-kine/settings/environment-variables
   - Add: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN=[your-dsn]`
   - Environment: Production
   - Click "Save"
5. **Redeploy**: Vercel → Deployments → Latest → "Redeploy"

**Test Sentry**:

```javascript
// Open browser console on your production site
Sentry.captureMessage('v1.4.0-beta deployment test');
// Check Sentry dashboard - should see event
```

**Set up alerts**:

- Error rate > 5% → Email/Slack alert
- New error type → Notify immediately

#### 2.2 Enable Vercel Analytics

**Why**: Track performance and user behavior

**Actions**:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/[team]/app-kine/analytics
2. **Click "Enable Analytics"** (if not enabled)
3. **Enable "Web Analytics"** checkbox
4. **Save**

**Metrics to watch (Day 1)**:

- Page load time (target: < 2s)
- Bounce rate (target: < 40%)
- Error rate (target: < 1%)

---

### **STEP 3: Complete Manual QA Validations (Do This Today)**

**Context**: QA gate required these manual validations before production. Since we went YOLO, do them NOW to catch issues early.

#### 3.1 Guest Mode Conversion Flow (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Time**: 10 minutes

**Test Steps**:

1. Open production URL in **incognito window**
2. Click "Try as Guest" (or equivalent)
3. Create a guest session:
   - Add patient name
   - Create session
   - Add exercises
4. Register account while in guest mode:
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Fill registration form
   - Submit
5. **VERIFY**: Guest session data persists after registration
   - Sessions still visible?
   - Patient data intact?
   - Exercises saved?

**If guest data is lost**: 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG** - See rollback section

#### 3.2 Authentication Flow (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Time**: 5 minutes

**Test Steps**:

1. **Register new account**:
   - Go to /register
   - Fill form with NEW email
   - Submit
   - Should redirect to dashboard
2. **Logout**:
   - Click logout button
   - Should redirect to login/home
3. **Login again**:
   - Use same credentials
   - Should access dashboard
4. **Check protected routes**:
   - Try to access /sessions directly while logged out
   - Should redirect to login

**If any step fails**: 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG** - See rollback section

#### 3.3 Core Session Management (P1)

**Time**: 5 minutes

**Test Steps**:

1. **Create session**:
   - Login to account
   - Click "New Session"
   - Add session details
   - Save
2. **Add exercises**:
   - Open session
   - Click "Add Exercise"
   - Fill exercise details
   - Save
3. **View session history**:
   - Go to sessions list
   - Verify new session appears
4. **Edit session**:
   - Click edit on session
   - Modify details
   - Save changes
5. **Delete session**:
   - Delete a test session
   - Verify it's removed from list

**If any step fails**: 🟡 **P1 BUG** - Log in GitHub but not blocking

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING & ROLLBACK

### If Deployment Failed (Vercel shows "Error")

#### Check Build Logs

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[team]/app-kine/deployments
2. Click on failed deployment
3. Click "Build Logs"
4. Look for error messages

**Common issues**:

- **TypeScript errors**: Expected (we skipped tsc), should not block
- **Module not found**: Check package.json dependencies
- **Environment variable missing**: Add in Vercel settings

#### Quick Fix: Redeploy

```bash
# Make a trivial change
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger redeploy"
git push origin main
```

### If Production Has Critical Bugs (P0)

#### When to Rollback:

- 🚨 Authentication completely broken (nobody can login)
- 🚨 Data loss (sessions/patients disappearing)
- 🚨 Error rate > 10%
- 🚨 Site completely down (500 errors)

#### How to Rollback (5 minutes):

**Step 1: Revert on GitHub**

```bash
# Find last good commit (before your deployment)
git log origin/main --oneline -10

# Revert to last good commit
git revert 5e91732..HEAD --no-commit
git commit -m "ROLLBACK: Revert v1.4.0-beta due to [ISSUE DESCRIPTION]"
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Verify Rollback**

- Check Vercel dashboard (new deployment starts)
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Test production URL
- Verify issue is resolved

**Step 3: Communicate**
Send email to beta testers who signed up:

```
Subject: ⚠️ Temporary Technical Issue
