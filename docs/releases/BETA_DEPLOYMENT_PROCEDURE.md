     -H "apikey: [ANON_KEY]"
   ```

#### 3.3 Run Staging Smoke Tests

**Deploy to Staging First**:

```bash
# Assuming staging branch exists
git checkout staging
git merge chore/fix-loop-20251013
git push origin staging
```

**Wait for Vercel deployment**, then:

```bash
# Test staging deployment
PREPROD_URL=https://revia-staging.vercel.app npm run smoke:preprod
```

  - [ ] Convert guest to registered user
  - [ ] Verify data persists after conversion
- [ ] Test Authentication:
  - [ ] Login
  - [ ] Logout
  - [ ] Register new account
  - [ ] Password reset flow

### Step 4: Create Release Tag

**When**: 2025-01-15 (After all validations pass)

# Create annotated release tag
git tag -a v1.4.0-beta -m "Beta release: MVP scope locked

- PRD v4.0 alignment (App-Kine ‚Üí Revia)
- Emergency build fixes for beta deployment
- Test pass rate: 93.6% (191/204)
- Bundle size: 213kB gzipped

Technical debt tracked for v1.5:
- 259 TypeScript errors deferred
- 13 test failures (P1 issues)
- Bundle size optimization needed"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.4.0-beta
```

### Step 5: Merge to Main

**When**: 2025-01-15 (After tag creation)

**Option A: Via GitHub UI** (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/[ORG]/revia/compare/main...chore/fix-loop-20251013
2. Click "Create Pull Request"
3. Title: `Release v1.4.0-beta: MVP Scope Lock + Emergency Build Fixes`
4. Use description from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` (see Appendix A)
5. Assign reviewers: PM (John), QA (Quinn)
6. Wait for approval
7. **Merge via "Squash and merge"** or **"Create a merge commit"** (preserve history)

**Option B: Via Git CLI**

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge release branch
git merge --no-ff chore/fix-loop-20251013 -m "Release v1.4.0-beta

Merge release branch for v1.4.0-beta deployment.
Includes MVP scope lock and emergency build fixes."

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Production (Vercel Auto-Deploy)

**When**: Immediately after merge to `main`

**Vercel will automatically deploy**:

1. Monitor deployment: https://vercel.com/[TEAM]/revia/deployments
2. Wait for "Ready" status (~2-3 minutes)
3. Verify deployment URL: https://revia.app (or your production domain)

**Post-Deployment Verification**:

```bash
# Smoke test production
curl -I https://revia.app
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK

# Check bundle size
curl -s https://revia.app/assets/index-*.js | wc -c
# Expected: ~725KB (uncompressed)
```

### Step 7: Enable Monitoring

**When**: Immediately after production deployment

#### 7.1 Sentry Setup

1. Navigate to: https://sentry.io/organizations/[ORG]/projects/revia/
2. Verify DSN is configured in Vercel environment variables
3. Test error tracking:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   Sentry.captureMessage('v1.4.0-beta deployment test');
   ```
4. Configure alert rules:
   - Error rate > 5% ‚Üí Immediate Slack alert
   - Performance degradation > 2s ‚Üí Warning

#### 7.2 Vercel Analytics

1. Navigate to: https://vercel.com/[TEAM]/revia/analytics
2. Enable Web Analytics (if not already enabled)
3. Monitor:
   - Page load time (target: < 2s)
   - Bounce rate (target: < 40%)
   - User flows (sessions ‚Üí exercises)

### Step 8: Health Check Validation

**When**: 5 minutes after production deployment

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://revia.app/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "version": "1.4.0-beta"}

# Test authentication endpoint
curl https://revia.app/api/health/auth
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "supabase": "connected"}
```

**If health checks fail**:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test Supabase connection
4. **If critical**: Execute rollback (see Step 11)
