  summary: |
    NFR PASS validation shows excellent progress in accessibility, security, and test
    infrastructure. Primary concern is bundle size (1099 KB vs 300 KB target).
    Application is functional and deployable but requires performance optimization.

conclusion: |
  The fix/nfr-pass branch shows substantial improvements in test infrastructure,
  accessibility, and security. The primary challenge is bundle size optimization
  (1099 KB vs 300 KB target). The application is functional, deployable, and secure,
  but requires performance optimization before meeting all NFR targets.

  Gate Decision: MINOR_CONCERNS - Application is ready for deployment with
  performance monitoring, but bundle size optimization is strongly recommended.
